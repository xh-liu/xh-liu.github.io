== About me
I am currently a Ph.D. student in [http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/ Multimedia Lab (MMLab)], the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/ Prof. Xiaogang Wang] and [http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/ Prof. Hongsheng Li]. Before that, I received bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering in [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html Tsinghua University (THU)] in 2017. My research interests are computer vision and deep learning.
